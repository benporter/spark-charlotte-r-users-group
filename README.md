Presentation to the Charlotte R Users Group on 7-20-2015

There are three files of interest here:

- The .R file is the R code used on the EC2 driver
- The .md file is the RMarkdown used to generate the html presentation in R
- The .html file is the presentation, created from RMarkdown

See my blog post on how to spin up an EC2 cluster and get going with RStudio:
